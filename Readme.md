# Adaptive Controller

Adaptive control works well with computed torque method. The computed torque method achieves stability by cancelling out the non-linear dynamics of the system thereby making the system linear. In order to cancel the dynamics of the system it is essential to know the parameters of the system. Often times it is not easy to determine the parameters accurately. Adaptive
control is useful when the parameters enter the equation of motion linearly.
